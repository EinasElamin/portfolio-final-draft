					<h2>1. Flowering Houseplants</h2>
					<p>
						Flowering plants bring color and vibrancy indoors, and on the plus side, some are even fragrant.
						No one can deny that the most beautiful phase of a plant is when it flowers. Similar to when a
						caterpillar turns into a butterfly! Here is the list of best flowering types of indoor plants.

					<h2>2. Low-Light Houseplants</h2>
					<p>
						The first and foremost thing to consider when choosing an indoor houseplant is weather it’s shade
						tolerant or not. As in the indoor space, it’s challenging to provide adequate sunlight; it’s
						crucial to choose plants that can tolerate low-lighting conditions. Check out some of the most
						shade-tolerant plants mentioned below.

					<h2>4. Succulents & Cacti</h2>
					<p>
						Many indoor plant growers do not take the right care of houseplants, especially if the plants are
						too demanding. The great news is that succulents and cacti do not require much attention. In
						fact, for them, less is more! Just make sure not to overdo watering as most of the desert plants
						die this way.
